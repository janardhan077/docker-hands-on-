1. Difference between git add and git commit
Command	Explanation	Example
git add	Moves file changes from the working directory to the staging area. It prepares files to be included in the next commit.	git add file.txt
git commit	Saves the staged changes permanently in the repository with a message describing the changes.	git commit -m "Added new feature"
2. What does the Staging Area do?
The staging area is an intermediate step between the working directory and the repository.

Purpose of staging area:

Lets developers review changes before committing
Helps organize commits logically
Allows committing only selected files instead of everything
Without a staging area, Git would commit every change directly, which would make commit history messy.

3. What information does git log show?
git log displays the history of commits in a repository.

It shows:

Commit ID (unique hash)
Author name
Date and time of the commit
Commit message
What is the .git/ folder and what happens if you delete it?

The .git/ folder is the hidden directory where Git stores all repository data.

It contains:

Commit history

Branch information

Configuration settings

Object database

If the .git/ folder is deleted, the directory will no longer be a Git repository, and all version history will be lost.

Example:

git log  What is the difference between a working directory, staging area, and repository?

Working Directory
This is where you edit and modify your project files.

Staging Area
This is a temporary place where changes are prepared before committing.

Repository
This is the database where Git permanently stores all commits and project history.
